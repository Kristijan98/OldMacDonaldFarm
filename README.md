# Old MacDonald Farm - RLDatix Home Challenge

This is my solution for the **Software Engineer II** home challenge at RLDatix.

---

## 📖 Project Description

This is a C# Console Application that demonstrates:
- **Polymorphism** and **data-driven programming**
- Reading external resources (text files, UTF-8 encoded)
- User input handling
- Clean separation of concerns using services and utilities

The app simulates a version of the nursery rhyme *Old MacDonald Had a Farm* with multiple design patterns.
