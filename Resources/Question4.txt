Question 4 - Macedonian Version (Localization)

To produce a Macedonian version of the program that can be translated by a non-technical external translation agency, I would:

1. Store all words (like the nursery rhyme, animal names, and sounds) in a resource file or external text/JSON file instead of hardcoding them in code.
2. Provide two files: one for English (Words.en) and one for Macedonian (Words.mk).
3. The external translation agency would only need to edit the Macedonian file (Words.mk) and provide translations. No code changes would be needed.
4. At runtime, the application would load the appropriate file based on user choice or system language.
5. This makes the solution scalable to multiple languages (German, French, etc.) just by adding new translation files.

Example:
English: "cow" -> "moo"
Macedonian: "крава" -> "мууу"
